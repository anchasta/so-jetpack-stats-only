The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack with only the Stats Module enabled. All the rest of the modules of Jetpack have been removed.

== Description ==

** IMPORTANT: This plugin is NOT the official [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) plugin by WordPress.com **

The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack 2.9.3 with only the Stats Module enabled. All the rest of the modules of Jetpack have been removed. 

The plugin is a full fork of Jetpack and it is therefore not necessary to have Jetpack itself installed. Actually, if you would do that, then things will rapidly fall apart :)

I have decided to only support this plugin through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-jetpack-stats-only/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue over at Github. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.

**PLEASE DO NOT POST YOUR ISSUES VIA THE WORDPRESS FORUMS**

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

== Installation ==

Go to **Plugins > Add New** in your WordPress Dashboard, do a search for "so jetpack stats only" and install it.

 1. Download zip file.

 2. Upload the zip file via the Plugins > Add New > Upload page &hellip; OR &hellip; unpack and upload with your favourite FTP client to the /plugins/ folder.

Done!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack and removes all the other modules; it does not do anything functional to/with Jetpack. Therefore any and all Jetpack related issues, should be directed to [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/support/wordpress-com-stats/).
