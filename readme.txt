The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack with only the Stats Module enabled. All the rest of the modules of Jetpack have been removed.

== Description ==

** IMPORTANT: This plugin is NOT the official [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) plugin by WordPress.com **

The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack with only the Stats Module enabled. All the rest of the modules of Jetpack have been removed. 

The plugin is a full fork of Jetpack and it is therefore not necessary to have Jetpack itself installed. Actually, if you would do that, then things will rapidly fall apart :)

= Background =

The plugin [Jetpack Lite](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-lite/) used to be a fork of Jetpack which only enabled the Stats, Shortlink and Widgets Modules. 

The last version of Jetpack Lite that was coded that way was [2.3.4.1](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-lite/changelog/).

From version 3.0 [Samuel Aguilera](http://profiles.wordpress.org/samuelaguilera/), the developer of Jetpack Lite, made a radical change to his plugin. Instead of a standalone plugin with a minimal footprint, Jetpack Lite became dependant on Jetpack (with a huge footprint), which therefore needs to be installed too.

And although with Jetpack Lite installed the total footprint of Jetpack decreases somewhat, compared to version 2.3.4.1 of Jetpack Lite the additional loading times are just not worth it.

Therefore I have decided to fork the last standalone version of Jetpack Lite (2.3.4.1), remove the shortlink and widget modules and rename it to <strong><em>SO Jetpack Stats Only</em></strong>.

Over time I will try to remove as much bloat as possible to keep this a lightweight Jetpack Stats Only WordPress plugin.

I have decided to only support this plugin through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-jetpack-stats-only/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue over at Github. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.

**PLEASE DO NOT POST YOUR ISSUES VIA THE WORDPRESS FORUMS**
