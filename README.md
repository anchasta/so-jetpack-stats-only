## Description

** IMPORTANT: This plugin is NOT the official [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) plugin by WordPress.com **

The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack with only the Stats Module enabled. All the rest of the modules of Jetpack have been removed. 

The plugin is a full fork of Jetpack and it is therefore not necessary to have Jetpack itself installed. Actually, if you would do that, then things will rapidly fall apart :)

### Background

The plugin [Jetpack Lite](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-lite/) used to be a fork of Jetpack which only enabled the Stats, Shortlink and Widgets Modules. 

The last version of Jetpack Lite that was coded that way was [2.3.4.1](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-lite/changelog/).

From version 3.0 [Samuel Aguilera](http://profiles.wordpress.org/samuelaguilera/), the developer of Jetpack Lite, made a radical change to his plugin. Instead of a standalone plugin with a minimal footprint, Jetpack Lite became depending on Jetpack (with a huge footprint), and which therefore needs to be installed too.

And although with Jetpack Lite installed the total footprint of Jetpack decreases somewhat, compared to version 2.3.4.1 of Jetpack Lite the additional loading times are just not worth it.

Therefore I have decided to fork the last standalone version of Jetpack Lite (2.3.4.1), remove the shortlink and widget modules and rename it to <strong><em>SO Jetpack Stats Only</em></strong>.

Over time I will try to remove as much bloat as possible to keep this a lightweight Jetpack Stats Only WordPress plugin.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I have an issue with the Stats Module of Jetpack, where can I get support?

The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack and removes all the other modules; it does not do anything functional to/with Jetpack. Therefore any and all Jetpack related issues, should be directed to [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/support/wordpress-com-stats/).
