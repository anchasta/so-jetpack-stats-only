The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack with only the Stats Module enabled. All the rest of the modules of Jetpack have been removed.

## Description

** IMPORTANT: This plugin is NOT the official [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) plugin by WordPress.com **

The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack 2.9.3 with only the Stats Module enabled. All the rest of the modules of Jetpack have been removed. 

The plugin is a full fork of Jetpack and it is therefore not necessary to have Jetpack itself installed. Actually, if you would do that, then things will rapidly fall apart :)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I received an email from "Jetpack by WordPress.com" that says if I don't update to Jetpack 2.9.3 the Stats Module may stop working; what should I do?

We have received those emails too and have therefore forked Jetpack 2.9.3 (for our version 2014.04.14). In our fork we adjusted the coded version to our own version number, and as that is not the same as Jetpack, they send out these emails to you. In version 2014.04.16 we have adjusted that and at the same time did some more cleaning up.
In other words, if you install the latest version of SO Jetpack Stats Only, you don't have to worry that your Site Stats will vanish.

### I have an issue with the Stats Module of Jetpack, where can I get support?

The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack and removes all the other modules; it does not do anything functional to/with Jetpack. Therefore any and all Jetpack related issues, should be directed to [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/support/wordpress-com-stats/).
