The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack with only the Stats Module enabled. All the rest of the modules of Jetpack have been removed.

## Description

** IMPORTANT: This plugin is NOT the official [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) plugin by WordPress.com **

The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack 2.9.3 with only the Stats Module enabled. All the rest of the modules of Jetpack have been removed. 

The plugin is a full fork of Jetpack and it is therefore not necessary to have Jetpack itself installed. Actually, if you would do that, then things will rapidly fall apart :)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I have an issue with the Stats Module of Jetpack, where can I get support?

The SO Jetpack Stats Only plugin is a fork of Jetpack and removes all the other modules; it does not do anything functional to/with Jetpack. Therefore any and all Jetpack related issues, should be directed to [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/support/wordpress-com-stats/).
